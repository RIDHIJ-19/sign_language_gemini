**IndicSign** is an innovative gesture recognition system aimed at enhancing communication for individuals using Indian Sign Language (ISL). By combining the power of Google’s **Gemini API** with modern web technologies, IndicSign translates hand gestures into readable text in real time—bridging the gap between ISL users and non-signers.

This project tackles one of the most crucial challenges faced by the hearing and speech-impaired community: accessibility in communication. IndicSign processes visual input using computer vision techniques and sends it to the Gemini API for intelligent analysis. The result is an accurate, fast, and user-friendly web interface that makes ISL more understandable to everyone.

Whether it’s used in classrooms, workplaces, or casual conversations, IndicSign fosters inclusivity, empathy, and equal opportunity by turning gestures into language. Its simple interface and powerful backend make it an accessible tool for real-world impact.
